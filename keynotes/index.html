                        <div class="text-eng text-justify">Traditionally, the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) was primarily concerned with designing and investigating interfaces between humans and machines. However, with recent technological advances, the concepts of "enhancing", "augmenting" or even "re-designing" humans themselves are becoming feasible and serious topics of scientific research as well as engineering development.
                            <br>
                            <br>"Augmented Human" is a term that I use to refer to this overall research direction. Augmented Human introduces a fundamental paradigm shift in HCI: from human-computer-interaction to human-computer-integration, and out abilities will be mutually connected through the networks (what we call IoA, or Internet of Abilities, as the next step of IoT: Internet of Things). In this talk, I will discuss rich possibilities and distinct challenges in enhancing human abilities. I will introduce our recent projects including design of flying cameras as our remote and external eyes, a home appliance that can increase your happiness, an organic physical wall/window that dynamically mediates the environment, and an immersive human-human connection concept called "JackIn."</div>

                        <div class="text-eng text-justify">In this talk I will review current thinking concerning the psychology of interactive human decision making. This topic is of increasing importance because of the increasing frequency with which human decisions are informed and made through interaction with technology. The review details evidence for the adaptive, embodied and context sensitive nature of human decision making. It also offers a theory of how the mutual constraints of the human visual system and visualisation design lead to emergent strategies for interaction. These strategies focus attention on certain kinds of information and ignore others; they determine apparent risk preferences and, ultimately, the quality of decisions made. (This talk describes work with Xiuli Chen, Aditya Acharya, Chris Baber, and Richard Lewis.) </div>

                        <div class="text-eng text-justify">Professor Andrew Howes Andrew Howes is Professor of Computer Science at University of Birmingham and Marshall Weinberg visiting professor at the University of Michigan. He has previously held academic posts at the University of Manchester, Cardiff University, Carnegie-Mellon University and the Medical Research Council, Cambridge. He is known for his work in Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction and he focuses on computational rationality, that is in computational models of human behaviour that adapt to human cognitive capacities, as well as to the statistical structure of the environment. His recent book offers a general integrative framework for understanding human interaction with technology (Payne and Howes, 2013). Professor Howes is an Associate Editor at the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies and Cognitive Science journal. He has been an Associate Chair for ACM SIGCHI for a number of years and he is program chair for the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (2017). His work has recently been funded by NASA (2015), by the US Air Force Research Laboratory (2013-2015), by the EU (SPEEDD: FP7-ICT-2013-11 2013-2017), and by the ESRC (ES/L00321X/1 2012-2014).
                            <br>
                            <br> A recent series of publications provide a start at over-turning the long held, and popular, misconception that human preferences are irrational (Howes et al, 2016). Inspired by work in machine learning, Howes and colleagues' Bayesian model of bounded optimal decision making shows when people make rational changes of preference (e.g. to a lottery with higher expected value but more risk). The work has potential applications in understanding the choices that people make with and through technology, for example, Lelis and Howes (2011). It also has the potential to provide a theoretical underpinning to recent interest in the use of information technology to drive behaviour change.
                            <br>
                            <br> Another contribution has been to show how framing the visual search problem faced by humans as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem can be used to explain otherwise puzzling phenomena in Human-Computer Interaction (Chen et al., 2015, 2017). Humans can only partially observe state because of the combined limitations of information visualisation technologies and the acuity of the human eye. With his colleagues, Howes's work shows how reinforcement learning methods can be used to predict the eye movement strategies deployed by users.</div>

                        <div class="text-eng text-justify">The process of generating schematic maps of salient objects from a set of pictures of an indoor environment is challenging. It has been an active area of research as it is crucial to a wide range of context- and location-aware services, as well as for general scene understanding. Although many automated systems have been developed to solve the problem, most of them either require predefining labels or expensive equipment, such as RGBD sensors or lasers, to scan the environment. We introduce a prototype system to show how human computations can be utilized to generate schematic maps from a set of pictures, without making strong assumptions or demanding extra devices. The system requires humans (crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turks) to do simple spatial mapping tasks in various conditions, and their data are aggregated by filtering and clustering techniques that allow salient cues to be identified in the pictures and their spatial relations to be inferred and projected on a two-dimensional map. Our results showed that the combination of human computations and machine clustering could lead to more-accurate schematized maps from imagery. We also discuss how our approach may have important insights on methods that leverage human computations in other areas.</div>
